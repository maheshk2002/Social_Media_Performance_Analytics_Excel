## 🛠️ Analytical Framework & Excel Skills
This project utilizes advanced Excel functions to transform raw campaign data into business intelligence:
* **Advanced Pivot Tables:** For multi-dimensional analysis of Platform vs. Content Type.
* **Calculated Metrics:** Engineered KPIs such as `Engagement Rate %`, `Cost Per Interaction`, and `Net Follower Velocity`.
* **Trend Analysis:** Using moving averages to smooth out daily volatility in follower growth.
* **Slicers & Timelines:** Creating an interactive interface for drilling down into specific quarters (e.g., `NewYearRefresh` launch window).

## 📊 Key Insights & Strategic Findings

### 1️⃣ Platform Efficiency (The "Instagram Paradox")
* **Observation:** While budget allocation was distributed, **Instagram** received a lower portion of Ad Spend compared to Twitter and YouTube.
* **Insight:** Despite lower spend, Instagram delivered the **highest Engagement Rate (~5.7%)** and strongest organic follower growth.
* **Conclusion:** Instagram is the most capital-efficient platform in the current mix.

### 2️⃣ Content Strategy & Hashtag Optimization
* **High-Impact Tags:** Analysis of hashtag volume vs. interaction revealed that **`#PepsiCoRefresh`** and **`#ThirstyForMore`** are the primary drivers of reach.
* **Format Performance:** * **Carousels & Images** outperformed Videos in terms of direct engagement (Likes/Comments).
    * **Recommendation:** Shift content production budget towards high-quality static assets and Carousels for better cost-efficiency.

### 3️⃣ Campaign Impact Analysis
Three major campaigns were analyzed for performance uplift:
| Campaign | Objective | Key Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`SummerSplash`** | Brand Awareness | **Highest Impressions (38k avg)**; successfully maximized top-of-funnel visibility. |
| **`NewYearRefresh`** | Product Launch | Drove the peak follower growth week (**Dec 30, 2024**), adding **6,530** net new followers. |
| **`FestiveRadiance`** | Engagement | Showed consistent engagement uplift during the active campaign window. |

### 4️⃣ Temporal Trends
* **Follower Growth:** Growth is not linear. Significant spikes correlate directly with specific campaign launch dates, validating the effectiveness of the paid media strategy in driving community size.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the quantitative analysis, the following strategic pivots are recommended:

1.  **Budget Reallocation:** Shift 15-20% of the Ad Spend from YouTube/Twitter to **Instagram**. The data proves Instagram yields a higher ROI per dollar spent.
2.  **Content Mix Optimization:** Reduce the frequency of high-production cost Videos on Twitter; replace them with **Image/Carousel** formats which show higher engagement rates.
3.  **Hashtag Consolidation:** Double down on **`#ThirstyForMore`** in organic posts to consolidate brand conversations under one high-performing tag.
4.  **Campaign Timing:** The `NewYearRefresh` success suggests that **end-of-year timing** is optimal for "Follower Acquisition" campaigns.
